Some useful tools for creating BIDs compliant datasets using SPM:

Basically, creating BIDs compliant json files for dataset descriptions, tables etc., can be pretty time-consuming. The idea is to try and take some of the pain out of that, and make it easier to do/revise. It has a few options where you can read in a json, allowing you to edit/create a datatables, or even merge several into one.

You will need to add to the spm/toolbox folder, as per most spm add ons. This has only been tested on SPM12 and MATLAB_R2019b/R2021b.

For a useful json library of standard measures, see https://github.com/qmaplab/phenotyping-json-library
Please consider adding to this library if you transcribe a scale/measure that is not present.

More tools built based on this to follow. I've also added a few other functions/snippits in the useful_functions folder

Some suggestions for useful BIDs tools for SPM:

Basically, creating BIDs compliant json files for dataset descriptions, tables etc., can be pretty time-consuming

The idea is to try and take some of the pain out of that, and make it easier to do/revise. It has a few options where you can read in a json, allowing you to edit/create a datatables, or even merge several into one.

For a useful library of standard measures, see https://github.com/qmaplab/phenotyping-json-library

To learn more about BIDS see: https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

More tools built based on this to follow. I've also added a few other functions/snippits in the useful_functions folder 

If you are generous enough to credit the toolbox, please simply by providing a link to the repository
